This project was created for Data 1030 at Brown University; under the instuction of Andras Zsom.

In an effort to not only reduce traffic, carbon emissions, and roadwear, but also improve public health in New York City; public officials launched a public bike share transportation alternative known as Citi Bike. Citi Bike became officially operational in 2013 and has been expanding ever since. Servicing Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City provides its share of logistical challenges. Applying machine learning techniques to publicly published Citi Bike data on their website, we can better understand their riders’ habits. 

A classification algorithm will allow us to identify how Citi Bike annual subscription riders differ from 24-hour pass or 3-day pass users. By successfully predicting whether or not a trip was conducted by a subscription rider or an everyday customer we can potentially find interesting insights into how their behaviors differ by investigating the model’s parameters. For the purposes of this project I will be looking into Citi Bike trip data over the last two years, from August, 2017 to August, 2019.
