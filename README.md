This project was created for the course, Data 1030 at Brown University; under the instuction of Andras Zsom.

In an effort to not only reduce traffic, carbon emissions, and roadwear, but also improve public health in New York City; public officials launched a public bike share transportation alternative known as Citi Bike. Citi Bike became officially operational in 2013 and has been expanding ever since. Servicing Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and Jersey City provides its share of logistical challenges. Applying machine learning techniques to publicly published Citi Bike data on their website, we can better understand their ridersâ€™ habits.
